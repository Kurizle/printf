The printf project is a collaboration assignment, were a function named "_printf" imitates the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library to produce several output values as a means of printing the data. The main prototype is the following:

int _printf(const char *format, ...)

Which contains the pointer format, that has the string that is printed. If the program runs successfully, the return value is the amount of chars printed.

What we are to learn from this project:
  •	How to use git in a team setting, or as a means to collaborate for project requirements,
  •	Applying variadic functions to a big project,
  •	The complexities of printf, as a function, and how to manipulate its application when in use during coding practice,
  •	Managing a lot of files and how to create a good workflow while creating code.
