The printf project is a collaboration assignment, were a function named "_printf" imitates the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library to produce several output values as a means of printing the data. The main prototype is the following:

int _printf(const char *format, ...)

Which contains the pointer format, that has the string that is printed. If the program runs successfully, the return value is the amount of chars printed.
